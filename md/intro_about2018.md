The data in the Data Explorer is slightly different from the data published in <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/jrc/en/publication/demographic-and-human-capital-scenarios-21st-century-2018-assessment-201-countries">Lutz, Goujon, KC, Stonawski, and Stilianakis (Eds.) (2018)</a> due to later data adjustments in the course of validating the Data Explorer 2.0, resulting in minor changes to the projections.
